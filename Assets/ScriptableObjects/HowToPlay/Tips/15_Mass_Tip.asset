  description: Planets all have an innate <sprite="text-icons" name="mass"> mass.
    Placing buildings on a planet increases its mass. Some buildings are heavy and
    will increase a planet's mass substantially. You can reduce the mass of planets
    by demolishing buildings or with Antimatter Spheres, which have negative mass.
