  title: Cable Tool
  description: 'The cable tool will connect buildings with <sprite="text-icons" name="cable">
    cables. Clicking on a building in the build menu will enable placing a cable
    and a building at the same time.


    Most buildings can support one cable connection.
    So, Pylons (which allow for more connections) are necessary for creating networks
    with more than one power plant and power consumer.'
