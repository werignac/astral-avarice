  title: Power Plants
  description: 'Power plants produce electricity. This electricity will power <sprite="text-icons"
    name="cable"> connected buildings. Connecting multiple power plants to the same
    grid enables powering multiple homes or more demanding homes.


    Some power
    plants come in tiers with cheap and expensive options. The cheap options don''t
    produce much electricity, but are useful in the early-game. The expensive options
    produce more electricity, but are unaffordable early on.'
